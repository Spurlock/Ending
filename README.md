Ending
======

ExpressionEngine 2 Plugin for outputting just the end of a string. Like character limit in reverse. You can use it to select a certain number of characters from the end, or tell it to look for a particular substring and have it select everything after that (for example, selecting everything after the "@" in an email address to get the email provider).
